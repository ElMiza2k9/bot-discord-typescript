	// Place your Ã¡rea de trabajo de Memz snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Generate subcommand base": {
		"scope": "javascript,typescript",
		"prefix": "!subcmd",
		"body": [
			"import { CommandInteraction } from 'discord.js'",
			"import Client from '../../../structs/Client'",
			"",
			"export default {",
			"  do: async (client: Client, interaction: CommandInteraction) => {",
			"    ",
			"  }",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "Crea un subcomando"
